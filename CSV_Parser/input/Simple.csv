State,Feature ID,Requirement ID,Requirement Summary,Requirement Description
_,,Control Requirements,,
NEW,31841,edfa.1.2,Gain Control Mode w. gain priority,Control signal gain to a provisioned level/ maintaining provisioned gain at expense of tilt
NEW,31841,edfa.1.3,ASE Power Mode on post amp,Disable input power using internal VOA and provide constant ASE output at the provisioned power level (post-amp only)
NEW,31841,edfa.1.5,Constant Current Control,Mainain pump currents at provisioned values.  VOA is not adjusted
INVALID,31841,edfa.1.7,Output Power limitting,Clamp total output power in gain mode to a provisioned limit.  Implementation depends on how fast customer requires response to transients in this mode
NEW,31841,edfa.1.8,Tilt Control,Control amp to provisioned tilt (0-2dB)/ subject to limits of VOA range.  Positive tilt is more gain at shorter wavelengths (not standard definition).  Post-Amp only/ Pre-Amp is always 0dB tilt
NEW,,,Fast Tilt Control,Provide input power dependant contribution to total tilt correction.  Control should converge in 60us
NEW,31841,edfa.1.9,Transient suppression,Maintain signal gain constant even when input power changes by a significant amount.  Allowable overshoot/undershoot and settling time for various input amplitude and rate changes may be specified by the customer
NEW,31841,edfa.1.12,TZ gain switching,Amplifier must switch TZ gains on power monitoring circuits to maintain sufficient dynamic range on ADCs/ with sufficient delay after gain switch event
NEW,,,ASE Compensation Mode,Support both auto and manual ASE compensation modes.  In manual mode/ calculated ASE compensation value in gain control mode can be over-written with a provisioned value
NEW,31841,edfa.1.13,Manual control of TZ gain switching,For test and calibration/ automatic control of gain switches can be disabled/ and the gain of any switch set manually
NEW,31841,edfa.1.14,Normal gain switch position,Amplifer must choose TZ gain switch setting based on provisioned gain/ as well as ADC counts/ to avoid gain switching during transient events
NEW,31841,edfa.1.15,External VOA Control (post-amp only),EDFA has a VOA in the optical path that is used for attenuation/ rather than for tilt control.  Attenuation target may be controlled by the customer/ or by an algorithm
NEW,31841,edfa.1.16,Disabling of control features for manufacturing,For manufacturing/ must be able to disable automatic control of fiber heater/ VOA/ DAC writes
NEW,31841,edfa.1.17,Filter reported power and ADC values,For manufacturing and customer reported values/ filter raw data to provide a more accurate measurement
